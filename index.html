                                <p><strong>The Soil Moisture and Fertility Analysis with Camera Integration</strong>
                                    project is a smart agriculture solution developed with the aim of improving farmers’
                                    conditions through the use of modern technology.</p>

                                <h4>Motivation</h4>
                                <p>Many farmers still rely on traditional methods and personal experience to judge soil
                                    quality and moisture levels, which often leads to over-irrigation, under-irrigation,
                                    low crop yield, and unnecessary fertilizer usage. The motivation behind this project
                                    was to provide farmers with a simple, accurate, and affordable technological tool
                                    that can help them make better decisions regarding watering and soil treatment,
                                    ultimately increasing productivity while reducing resource wastage.</p>

                                <h4>How It Works</h4>
                                <p>The system combines IoT hardware, computer vision, and machine learning to analyze
                                    soil conditions in real time. An Arduino-based setup is used along with a camera
                                    module to capture soil images directly from the field. These images are then
                                    processed using YOLOv8-based deep learning models, which analyze visual patterns,
                                    texture, and color variations in the soil to determine its fertility level and
                                    moisture condition.</p>

                                <h4>Key Metrics</h4>
                                <p>On a daily basis, the system is capable of analyzing 500+ soil images, providing
                                    consistent and scalable monitoring. The machine learning model achieved <strong>92%
                                        accuracy</strong> in soil fertility detection and <strong>88% accuracy</strong>
                                    in moisture classification, ensuring reliable results for real-world agricultural
                                    use.</p>

                                <h4>Farmer-Friendly Interface</h4>
                                <p>To make the system farmer-friendly, the processed results are displayed through a
                                    web-based interface developed using Flask, HTML, and CSS. This interface presents
                                    clear insights such as:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Current soil moisture level</li>
                                    <li>Soil fertility status</li>
                                    <li>Recommendations for irrigation and fertilizer usage</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h4>Impact</h4>
                                <p>By using accurate data instead of guesswork, farmers can avoid excessive watering and
                                    fertilizer application. As a result, the system helps in reducing water usage by
                                    20–25%, lowering operational costs and promoting sustainable farming practices.</p>

                                <p>Overall, this project demonstrates how IoT and AI-driven solutions can empower
                                    farmers by providing them with actionable insights, improving crop yield, conserving
                                    natural resources, and supporting long-term agricultural sustainability.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Predictive Analytics in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)</strong> project
                                    focuses on using artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to support the
                                    early and accurate diagnosis of autism.</p>

                                <h4>Motivation & Problem</h4>
                                <p>Autism Spectrum Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects
                                    communication, behavior, and social interaction. Early diagnosis plays a critical
                                    role in enabling timely intervention. However, traditional diagnosis methods largely
                                    depend on behavioral observations and expert judgment, which can be time-consuming,
                                    subjective, and prone to inconsistencies, often leading to delayed diagnosis or
                                    false positives.</p>

                                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                                <p>The motivation behind this project was to design a data-driven and objective
                                    diagnostic support system that can assist healthcare professionals by improving
                                    diagnostic accuracy and reducing uncertainty. By leveraging deep learning models,
                                    the system aims to identify autism-related patterns at an early stage, making the
                                    diagnostic process faster and more reliable.</p>

                                <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
                                <p>In this project, a <strong>Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)</strong> was developed
                                    using <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>Keras</strong>. The model was trained
                                    on 5,000+ datasets, which include relevant features associated with Autism Spectrum
                                    Disorder. CNNs are particularly effective in identifying complex and non-linear
                                    patterns in data, making them well-suited for medical prediction tasks.</p>

                                <h4>Results & Impact</h4>
                                <p>After training and evaluation, the model achieved a <strong>prediction accuracy of
                                        94%</strong>, demonstrating strong diagnostic capability. Additionally, the
                                    system successfully <strong>reduced false positive rates by 15%</strong>, which is
                                    critical in avoiding unnecessary stress, misdiagnosis, and incorrect treatment
                                    plans.</p>

                                <p>By improving diagnostic precision, this project contributes to early autism
                                    detection, enabling healthcare professionals and caregivers to initiate timely
                                    intervention strategies. The system is intended to act as a decision-support tool,
                                    assisting clinicians rather than replacing professional medical judgment.</p>

                                <p>Overall, this project highlights the potential of AI-driven predictive analytics in
                                    healthcare, specifically in neurodevelopmental disorder diagnosis, enhancing

                                            fast, and accurate attendance system that leverages computer vision and
                                            embedded systems. Especially after the COVID-19 period, the need for
                                            touch-free and automated systems became more important for hygiene,
                                            efficiency, and scalability.</p>

                                        <h4>How It Works</h4>
                                        <p>The system uses an <strong>ESP32 camera module</strong> to capture facial
                                            images of individuals in real time. These images are processed using
                                            <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong>, where facial features
                                            are detected and compared against a pre-stored database using the
                                            <strong>face_recognition</strong> library. Once a face is successfully
                                            recognized, the system automatically marks the attendance of the individual.
                                        </p>

                                        <h4>Performance & Tech Stack</h4>
                                        <p>The system is capable of recognizing <strong>100+ faces in under 2
                                                seconds</strong>, making it suitable for real-time classroom or office
                                            environments. Attendance data is stored and managed efficiently using Pandas
                                            and NumPy, enabling structured record-keeping and easy data analysis.</p>

                                        <h4>Impact</h4>
                                        <p>During evaluation, the system achieved an <strong>overall recognition
                                                accuracy of 95%</strong>, ensuring reliable performance in real-world
                                            conditions. By automating the attendance process, the system saves
                                            approximately <strong>15 minutes per session</strong>, significantly
                                            improving productivity for instructors and administrators.</p>

                                        <p>This project demonstrates how embedded hardware (ESP32) combined with
                                            computer vision and machine learning techniques can solve everyday
                                            administrative problems, highlighting the practical application of AI in
                                            building smart, efficient, and scalable systems.</p>

                                <p><strong>The Drug Discovery and Management System</strong> is a web-based healthcare
                                    platform developed to address two major challenges in the pharmaceutical domain:
                                    medicine supply chain management and efficient drug discovery and accessibility.</p>

                                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                                <p>The idea for this project originated during the COVID-19 pandemic (2020), when
                                    governments and healthcare authorities faced serious difficulties in tracking
                                    medicine manufacturing, distribution, and availability. Despite sufficient
                                    production, medicines often failed to reach the right places at the right time due
                                    to the absence of a centralized monitoring system. This resulted in shortages, black
                                    marketing, panic buying, and lack of transparency.</p>

                                <h4>The Solution</h4>
                                <p>To address this issue, we designed a centralized digital platform that allows
                                    medicines to be tracked end-to-end, starting from the manufacturer, moving through
                                    retailers, and finally reaching local medical shops where customers can easily
                                    purchase them. This enables better visibility, accountability, and control over the
                                    pharmaceutical supply chain.</p>

                                <h4>Drug Discovery & Analysis</h4>
                                <p>In addition to management, the project also focuses on the drug discovery and search
                                    process. Traditional drug analysis and discovery methods are time-consuming and
                                    computationally expensive. To overcome this, we applied machine learning techniques
                                    on a dataset of 10,000+ drug compounds to speed up analysis and improve prediction
                                    efficiency. As a result, the system reduces drug analysis time by 40% and improves
                                    prediction efficiency by 30%, significantly accelerating the discovery process.</p>

                                <h4>Intelligent Drug Search</h4>
                                <p>A key feature of the system is its intelligent drug search functionality. When a user
                                    searches for a medicine (for example, a branded drug like Dolo), the system not only
                                    checks its availability in nearby locations but also automatically suggests:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Alternative branded medicines with the same composition</li>
                                    <li>Generic medicines that are safe, approved, and more affordable</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>This feature is especially useful during shortages, as it reduces dependency on a
                                    single brand and promotes awareness of cost-effective generic options.</p>

                                <h4>Tech Stack</h4>
                                <p>The entire system is implemented using <strong>Python</strong>, with data processing
                                    handled by <strong>Pandas</strong> and <strong>NumPy</strong>, machine learning
                                    models developed using <strong>TensorFlow</strong>, and a user-friendly web
                                    interface built using <strong>Streamlit</strong>.</p>
